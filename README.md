üõ°Ô∏è SecureLoan: AI-Powered Fraud Detection & Geolocation Loan Approval SystemSecureLoan is a robust web application designed to drastically reduce fraudulent loan applications by leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and real-time geolocation analysis. It provides a secure, multi-layered verification process for applicants and an in-depth monitoring dashboard for officers.‚ú® Key FeaturesSecureLoan integrates several cutting-edge features to ensure maximum security and efficiency:1. AI-Powered Fraud Detection & SecurityTyping Speed and Hesitation Analysis: Utilizes AIML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) models to analyze user typing speed, hesitation patterns, and corrections during the application process, flagging potentially automated or suspicious behavior.Geolocation and IP Inconsistency Detection:Captures and verifies the applicant's real-time geolocation during the application.Compares the applicant's IP address with their declared location and prior data for inconsistencies.Monitored within the Officer Dashboard to immediately alert officers to potential spoofing or fraudulent location masking.2. Document Verification & Data ExtractionAadhaar Card Photo Upload & Verification: Applicants can securely upload an image of their Aadhaar (or similar national ID) card.Data Extraction & Cross-Check: The system uses OCR and computer vision to extract data (Name, DOB, Address, etc.) from the uploaded photo and automatically verifies it against registered/government databases (if integrated) or internal records.3. Secure Application WorkflowFull Loan Application Form: Provides a complete, user-friendly form for all necessary loan details.Integrated CAPTCHA: Secures the submission process against bots and automated scripts.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackCategoryTechnologiesFrontendReact, Next.js, or similar (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript)BackendPython (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express)DatabasePostgreSQL or MongoDBAI/MLTensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn (for AIML models)OCR/VisionTesseract, OpenCV, or cloud-based vision APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Vision)GeolocationBrowser Geolocation API, IP Geolocation ServicesDeploymentDocker, AWS/Azure/GCPüöÄ Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js (for frontend)Python (for backend/AIML)Database installed (e.g., PostgreSQL)Required API keys (e.g., Geolocation, Vision APIs)InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/secureloan.git
